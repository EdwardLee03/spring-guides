/**
 * Although you can to package this service as a traditional WAR file for deployment to an external application server,
 * the simpler approach demonstrated below creates a standalone application.
 * You package everything in a single, executable JAR file, driven by a good old Java main() method.
 * Along the way, you use Reactive Springâ€™s support for embedding the Netty server as the HTTP runtime,
 * instead of deploying to an external instance.
